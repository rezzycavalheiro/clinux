### C Programming Linux

This is a repository with my programs written for the course " C Programming with Linux" from edx.org. 
All of the codes were written by me, **Renata Cavalheiro**. ðŸ‘½

To know what each program does, read the description in the README.md in each of the folders.
If you would like, you can clone the repository and test them on your own machine. 

*If you do find any errors or think something could be improved, please feel free to leave a comment or fork it as you wish!*
